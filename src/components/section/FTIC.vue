      On a rainy afternoon in 2013 I built a small game in order to try out the
      new Web Audio API. I published and move onto other things, quickly
      forgetting about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months later I was browsing Reddit when I came across my very own
      game on the front page! It received over a million hits that week, and
      since then has received publicity on CNN, Mashable, Buzfeed, and countless
      other "news" sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the game's inception, 29,000,000 invisible cows have been found by
      9,500,000 unique players.
